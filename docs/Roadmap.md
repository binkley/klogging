In no particular order at this stage.

## Within the library

- Support platforms other than JVM.
- Extensive performance testing of event creation and dispatching.

## Addition to the library

- Create a [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) plugin with options for automatically
  capturing and logging request and other context information.
- Create an [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) binding for KtLogging.
